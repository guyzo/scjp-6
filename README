To checkout the project : git clone git@github.com:lepnio/scjp-6.git

Each chapter is put in a different project.

Do not commit Eclipse, Intellij, or NetBeans specific files.

Respect the following package convention : scjp.chapter.<number>.<your-name>

--Well, here this is mehdi speaking (writing)

First thanks Etienne, I followed your pattern and what you described to submit new exercises.

In the same time I have a suggestion : 

I created a maven project for chapter 2 (under ch2) to make it easier getting the classes 
and then importing them in eclipse (for example) to run and check them.

for this project I followed another package convention scjp.chapter2.<yourname>
(scjp : groupId, chapter2 : artifactId since you chose to create a project for each chapter)

I added the exercises that have been already submitted.

Finally I added a gitignore file suited for eclipse.

Thank you.
